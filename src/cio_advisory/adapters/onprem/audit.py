"""On-prem placeholder for ``AuditSinkPort`` : the on-premise migration target.

One of the reversibility (P-02) migration placeholders: in the managed profile this port
binds to the Cloud Logging locked-WORM-bucket adapter; switching ``profile`` to ``onprem``
rebinds it here. The adapter constructs cleanly with **no external dependencies** and
structurally satisfies the same Protocol as the managed adapter. ``record`` deliberately
raises rather than discarding the event: an unimplemented audit sink must never silently
drop a compliance record, so porting on-premise *must* supply a real immutable (WORM)
audit store. Filling this body in is the only change required.
